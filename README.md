# ComfyUI_Artcoder
This project is a custom node for ComfyUI that uses [ArtCoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07815) [CVPR 2021] to refine videos generated by [AnimateDiff](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04725) [ICLR2024 Spotlight] or the other video. The node is to transform these videos into functional QR code videos that can be scanned.

## Some demo


## Artcoder Params
content_images: Images generate by AnimateDiff
qr_image: QR code image
content_scaling: scaling for content
qr_scaling: scaling for scanablity
resize_width: output width
resize_height: output height
iteration: ArtCoder refinement iterations
